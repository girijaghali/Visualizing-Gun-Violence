# Visualizing-Gun-Violence

Embedded deep into the social fabrics of the nation of The United States is the right to bear arms. However, the relationship between guns and people has grown more complicated in modern times, with stories about gun violence permeating media outlets.

In this study, we want to visualize:

(1)    Geo-density of gun violence in 2018, with maps showing Total Number of Incidents, Home Invasions, Defensive Use, and Unintentional Shootings. The data was downloaded from http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/

(2)    Support of gun control based on: education, income, gender, political party, and race. The dataset was taken from Pew Research Center, using survey responses from 'America's Complex Relationship with Guns', conducted March-April 2017.

(3)    Existence of mass shooting trends from 1982-2018.

(4)    Correlation between gun death rate and gun law strength.

(5)    Gun death rate by state with reference to the gun death rate by state per capita.
